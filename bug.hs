This code suffers from a subtle bug related to lazy evaluation in Haskell. The `calculate` function attempts to compute the sum of a list, but due to lazy evaluation, the `length` function is never called, leading to an infinite loop when dealing with an infinite list.

```haskell
calculate :: [Int] -> Int
calculate xs = sum xs + length xs

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let infiniteList = [1..]  --Infinite list
  print (calculate infiniteList) -- This will lead to an infinite loop
```
